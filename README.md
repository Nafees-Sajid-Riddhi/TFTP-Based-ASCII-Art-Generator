# TFTP-Based-ASCII-Art-Generator
A Java-based project demonstrating the use of the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) for the Application Layer Programming course. The program uses pre-stored text files containing ASCII art. The server prompts users to request a file name, and the client retrieves and displays the ASCII art, showcasing how TFTP works in practice.
